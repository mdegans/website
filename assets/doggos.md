I love dogs. The past few years some of my happiest moments were at the dog park with my Samoyed, "Iorek" and dwarf Spitz, "Chewie". Both were adopted. Before that I adopted a Romanian street dog, "Puppy", who lived to the age of 20 and a Golden, "Benson". Sadly, All of them have since passed, but I'm glad to have had their company of the years and am left with many happy memories. Here are some of them.
