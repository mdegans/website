The assets in doggos/ and /gallery are all rights reserve Michael de Gans. If
you want high resolution versions for wallpaper personal use, send me an email.
Many of the panoramas are multi-gigapixel, so if you've got a bunch of screens,
I have wallpaper. Available in high bit depth with HDR color profiles as well.
