I'm a software developer with a background in visual arts. I've worked in computer vision, machine learning, and robotics. I'm currently working on [a collaborative writing app](https://github.com/mdegans/weave) leveraging local and cloud-based language models. Grab a release for macOS (Metal) or Linux (CUDA) [here](https://github.com/mdegans/weave/releases).
