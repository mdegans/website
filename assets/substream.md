[Substream](https://github.com/mdegans/substream) transcribes audio to .srt subtitle format using Google's Speech-to-Text API.

I wrote back in 2019 it because the director's commentary tracks on HBO's UHD blu-rays do not have subtitles because HBO does not care about accessability or the [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/).

It was my first Python project [published to PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/substream/).

<!-- also fuck HBO -->
