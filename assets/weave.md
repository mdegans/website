[Weave](https://github.com/mdegans/weave) is a story tree writing app for Human/AI collaboration inspired by [Loom](https://github.com/socketteer/loom). It is written in Rust and supports:

- local language models, using the [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) backend, powered by [Drama LLaMA](https://github.com/mdegans/drama_llama)
- OpenAI's models, including GPT-4o, using the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction).
