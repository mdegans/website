[NValhalla](https://github.com/mdegans/nvalhalla) is a social distancing and redaction tool for video streams using DeepStream. I wrote it during the Covid lockdown.

It's written in a Vala dialect, Genie, which generates GObject C (so as to avoid touching that directly). It uses the GStreamer multimedia framework and the DeepStream SDK from NVIDIA.

See a video of it in action on the infinite fountain of misinformation, YouTube, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjP_3oOnUtQ).
