I enjoy all kinds of video games. They're fun to play and I'm fascinated with aspects of game design.

Most recently I've been playing [Horizon: Forbidden West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_Forbidden_West) and [Elden Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Ring).

I also enjoy watching [Game Maker's Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/user/McBacon1337) on YouTube. It's a great channel for learning about game design.
