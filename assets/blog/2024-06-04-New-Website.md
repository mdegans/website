So I decided to write a new website, this time in Rust. Why? Because I'm tired of updating wordpress and getting spam comments for a comment section that is supposed to be both disabled and hidden. All for content that might as well be static.

I'm tired of the security issues. So, here we are with a static site because there isn't a reason not to. I write in markdown, which on save triggers `build.rs` which adds and entry in `/src/blog/entries.rs` which is built into the binary, and because text is highly compressible, the binary is small and fast, even storing all the blog entries in memory. All I need to do from there is commit and `git push` and the site is updated.

The markdown is parsed with [`egui-commonmark`](https://docs.rs/egui_commonmark/latest/egui_commonmark/) which creates appropriate widgets. There's also some [infinite scroll](https://docs.rs/egui_infinite_scroll/latest/egui_infinite_scroll/) but there's a small [issue](https://github.com/lucasmerlin/hello_egui/issues/26) where the scroll elements disappear when the window is refreshed. I'll track that down in time.

Eventually I'll grab the blog entries from elsewhere, like static files, but there isn't a reason to do that yet. So far so good. The site is fast and does what I want. I don't really care if scrapers can get to it since they'll just use it to train AI models. It's for human eyes. I could generate html from the markdown as well for scrapers, but I don't care enough to do that yet.
